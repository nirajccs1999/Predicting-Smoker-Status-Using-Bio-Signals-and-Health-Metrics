## Project Description

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts smoking behavior based on health and demographic data. The dataset contains various health-related features such as height, weight, and hemoglobin levels.

The project compares the performance of multiple machine learning algorithms including **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost** to assess which model provides the best prediction accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of various health-related features that can be used to predict smoking behavior. The dataset has two primary classes:

- **Class 0**: Non-Smoking
- **Class 1**: Smoking

### Key Features:
- **Height**: Height of the individual (in cm).
- **Hemoglobin**: Hemoglobin levels in the blood.
- **Other Health Parameters**: Various health-related features that may influence smoking behavior.

## Model Evaluation

### Metrics Used:
- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correctly classified instances.
- **AUC-ROC**: Area Under the Curve of the Receiver Operating Characteristic, used to evaluate the binary classification performance.
- **Cross-validation Accuracy**: Accuracy scores calculated using 10-fold cross-validation to assess the modelâ€™s generalization ability.

## Files

- **`smoke.ipynb`**: This is the Jupyter notebook where the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation is written. It contains the implementation of the machine learning algorithms and performance evaluation.
- **`smoke_dataset.csv`**: The main dataset used for training and testing the models. This dataset contains various health-related features to predict smoking behavior.
- **`smoke_dataset-test.csv`**: This is the unseen data used for making predictions using the trained model.
- **`smoke_dataset_test_with_prediction.csv`**: This file contains the predictions made by the model on the `smoke_dataset-test.csv` file. It includes the original data along with the predicted smoking status.
